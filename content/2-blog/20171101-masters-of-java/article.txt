This was the first time Masters of Java would be held separately from our Dutch counterparts, although both events were ran simultaneously. There was an attempt to get a livestream going both ways but it was a bit haphazard as they are oft to be.

I attended the event with Arthur Saprunov, a fellow student. We did our best to prepare beforehand by doing some assignments from previous installments. Unfortunately the 30 minute time constraint ended up being a large thorn in our side. The lack of "proper" IDE wasn't something we expected either and took us a bit to get used to.

As for results, we didn't score too great. There were 2 assignments where we were really close to a finalized solution but fell out due to time constraints. I am happy to report we didn't end up with 0 points though, so at least we weren't last!

Something I didn't notice during the event...

...is how when people think...

...they all gravitate towards the chin.
