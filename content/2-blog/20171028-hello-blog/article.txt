On this fine Saturday a mediocre blog was born.

This has actually been rewritten (sort of) for the Kirby CMS and we originally going into a Laravel setup but I've found Kirby a lot more fluent to work with so I've ported them over.

Although I usually think of myself as being language agnostic I must confess that PHP doesn't come as easy to me. I think it's the differing syntax and various structures that are different to what I've grown used to when making web-based things.

I'd rather work around it if possible, much like what I've done here!
