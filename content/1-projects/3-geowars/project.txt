Geowars was a semester spanning group project during the second year where we were tasked to make a "spinoff" of a game called Geometry Wars in Java.

We made use of the (link: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ text: LibGDX) to help speed development. We also opted to implement physics in our game, which we did using the Box2D physics engine that LibGDX has bindings for.

The source code is available on (link: https://github.com/RiceKab/project-geowars text: github).
