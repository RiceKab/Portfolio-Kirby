A mod for the game "Arma 3" containing mainly scripts for AI behaviour and equipment setup for mission makers. Started originally due to me wanting to reuse custom behaviour I had implemented in a specific mission before.

The goal is to make missions both easier to setup and more atmospheric by allowing AI to engage in unusual behaviour.

An older version of the source code is available publicly on (link: https://github.com/RiceKab/TGC_Athena text: Github) as this mod has since merged with another project that is closed source.
